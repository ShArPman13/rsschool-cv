![About](assets/icons/about.svg) **ABOUT ME**

Hello! My name is Alexey. It’s one of the tasks in my programming school.

I’m learning javascript. I love programming and solving
algorithmic problems. I’m also learning CSS and want to become a great frontend developer.
And maybe not only frontend!

I really hope to successfully complete the courses and find a job.
