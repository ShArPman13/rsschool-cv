![About](assets/icons/about.svg) **ABOUT ME**

Hello! My name is Alexey. It’s one of the tasks in my programming school.

I’m learning javascript. I love programming and solving
algorithmic problems. I’m also learning CSS and want to become a great frontend developer.
And maybe not only frontend!
I always strive to learn and learn something new for myself . If I encounter difficulties, I find any option to solve them.

I really hope to successfully complete the courses and find a job.
